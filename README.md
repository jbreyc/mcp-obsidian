# MCP server for Obsidian (TypeScript + Bun)

> A Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) server that lets Claude (or any MCP-compatible LLM) interact with your Obsidian vault through the [**Local REST API**](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) community plugin ‚Äì written in **TypeScript** and runnable with **bunx**.
>
> This is an enhanced fork of [@fazer-ai/mcp-obsidian](https://github.com/fazer-ai/mcp-obsidian) with added support for HTTP/HTTPS transport modes and Docker deployment.

## üöù Transport Modes

This server supports three transport modes:

1. **stdio** (default) - Direct process communication for Claude Desktop
2. **HTTP** - Web server on port 4000 for development
3. **HTTPS** - Secure web server on port 4443 for production

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Obsidian REST API key

There are two ways to pass the Obsidian API key to the server:

1. **Server config (recommended)** ‚Äì pass it via the `env` field in your Claude (or other client) MCP-server declaration:

```jsonc
// claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-obsidian": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-obsidian/src/index.ts"],
      "env": {
        "OBSIDIAN_API_KEY": "your-obsidian-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Alternatively, you can use an **`.env` file**. Place the key in the `.env` you created above. Note it must be placed in the working directory where the MCP server is running.


### Environment variables

You can use the `.env.example` file as reference to create your own `.env` file.

## üê≥ Docker Support

For production deployments, use Docker with HTTP/HTTPS transport:

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t mcp-obsidian .

# Run with docker-compose
docker compose --profile http up -d   # HTTP mode
docker compose --profile https up -d  # HTTPS mode
```

### SSL Certificates (HTTPS mode)

For HTTPS mode, generate certificates:
```bash
# Development certificates
./scripts/generate-dev-cert.sh

# Or use openssl directly
mkdir -p certs
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout certs/key.pem -out certs/cert.pem \
  -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost"
```

### Docker Troubleshooting

**Connection to Obsidian fails:**
- Use `OBSIDIAN_HOST=host.docker.internal` in your `.env` file
- On Linux, you may need `OBSIDIAN_HOST=172.17.0.1`

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Change external port
HTTP_EXTERNAL_PORT=3001 docker compose --profile http up
```

**Check container health:**
```bash
docker compose ps
curl http://localhost:4000/health     # HTTP mode
curl -k https://localhost:4443/health # HTTPS mode
```
